## The naming convention

I'm not a creative person, so the idea to handle the components' names was using numerical order. I know, probably in a future is something that could not make sense, but for this first version, I think it's ok!

Basically, this is the structure:

_componentecategory-number_

## Steps

- 🍴 Fork this repo!
- 🔥 Install all the dependencies running `npm install` or `yarn`.
- 💎 In order to create the initial scaffolding for your _ui component_, run `yarn ui` or `npm run ui` and then you're going to be asked about the name of your component. Write it and press enter (important note: don't use spaces or special characters). More info about [the naming convention](#the-naming-convention).
- 🚀 To start running locally the project, run `yarn start` or `npm start`.
- 🚢 Open your browser on `http://localhost:9001/your-component`.
- 💡 Be creative!
